## 📊 Hierarchical Clustering with Dendrogram & Agglomerative Clustering:
Welcome to my hands-on project on Hierarchical Clustering, completed as part of a practical session conducted by Intellipaat. This repository demonstrates the end-to-end process of preparing data for unsupervised machine learning models and applying Agglomerative Clustering with a powerful visual insight using Dendrograms.

## 🚀 What You Will Find in This Project
🔄 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing raw data to be suitable for clustering algorithms.

🧠 Unsupervised Learning: A focus on Hierarchical Clustering, especially the Agglomerative approach.

🌿 Dendrogram Analysis: Visualizing how data points are grouped together in a tree-like structure to determine the optimal number of clusters.

📌 Agglomerative Clustering: Applying a bottom-up clustering technique that starts with each data point as its own cluster and merges them step by step based on similarity.

📈 Insights & Visualization: Interpreting the cluster structure and behavior through clear, informative plots.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn

## 📚 Learning Outcome
Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in:

Preprocessing datasets for unsupervised models

Understanding and implementing hierarchical clustering

Using dendrograms to make informed clustering decisions

Performing real-world data analysis using Agglomerative Clustering

## Feel free to explore the code, play with the data, and visualize how hierarchical clustering uncovers hidden patterns!
